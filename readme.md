Very basic web frontend for an sqlite database, based on the python bottle framework.

Inspired by https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial_app.html#using-bottle-for-a-web-based-todo-list

No support for user authentication yet.

To try it:
* git clone <this>
* python todo.py in shell
* open localhost:8080 in browser
